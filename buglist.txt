by Papa:
 * energy run out too fast!
 * scorpions got wrong animations
 * npc doesnt atk while chasing even withing close range
 * if npc gets stuck while chasing, it will just stand still even when you come near it.
 * talking to alkharid border guards without being close to the gate makes you not cross and lose the 10 gp.
 * can't climb stairs on lumby castle
 * "squeeze-through" fence(3240, 3190) is a f2p short-cut non agility related.
 * if while walking you click on "run on" button it just keep walking until next click.
